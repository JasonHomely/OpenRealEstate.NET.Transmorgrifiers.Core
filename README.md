# OpenRealEstate.NET Transmorgrifier's : Core

This is the base interface for all the "transmorgrifier's" in the project. A transmorgrifier is a fancy name for a OpenRealEstate library which converts some source format (e.g. xml or csv) into an OpenRealEstate model, defined in the 'Core' repository based upon the common Schema/model.

> FUN FACT: What is a `Transmogrifier`? To [quote the Calvin and Hobbes Wiki](http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Transmogrifier): "The Transmogrifier is an invention of Calvin's that would turn one thing into another."
